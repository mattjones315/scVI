    or sparse matrix, for example, but rather assumes that an scVI GeneExpressionDataset has 
    already been created. The resulting API of the dataset remains very similar to that of a 
    typical GeneExpressionDataset but with the addition of a tree (of class `ete3.Tree`) that 
    will be used as a prior during model fitting.
